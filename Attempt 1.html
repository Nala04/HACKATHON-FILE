    <section id="Interests">
      <h2>Sooo, let's explore things I actually like</h2>
        <p>Learning : I love discovering information about anything and everything.
           I can say that I am an active learner. Be it from biology, to I am open
           to it all. It makes me appreciate the world more, notice and understand
           systems, mentalities and behaviours. </p>

        <p>Creative Arts : I'm a theatre girl... I love the stage, the lights, the 
           acting, singing, dancing, costumes. The drama of it all. I started acting 
           and dancing in church. Typical, I knoooowww. I got to do more of this
           through primary school and highschool. Fun fact: I even got to Churchill 
           Show and State House through Music Festivals</p>

    <section id="Projects">
      <h2>What has Sandra been up to?</h2>
        <p>As an Engineering Student my projects have been in CAD softwares. I have worked with Inventor and SolidWorks</p>
            <ol> 
              <li><h4>Exam Project</h4></li>
                 <p>This is the first fairly detailed designed I did. It was for my 2.2 Semester
                  It involved understanding the structure of a component using its orthographic
                  drawings then creating a 3D structure of it. It was a project that took 3 hours
                  to complete. I was working with my classmate.</p>

              <li><h4>FSAE Project</h4></li>
                 <p>This is what I am currently working on. It's for motorsport competition. We are to
                 create a working Formula 1 car that will compete against others internationally. My
                 task is to design a driver template based on our driver's dimensions and position him
                 based on the seat requirement rules.</p>
